            <p class="intro">NZ tech startups are great at innovation, but growing pains can sometimes leave them
                struggling to keep pace
                with demand.</p>
            <h4 class="question prep">Profitability potential</h4>
            <p>Finding something that is in demand is hard enough.
                But to have found that demand and then not be able to keep up with it is incredibly
                frustrating. Ultimately, the potential profitability of the company is not realised—so the
                business loses, investors lose and the NZ economy loses.</p>
            <h4 class="question prep">Our results</h4>
            <p>We were able to get ahead of these growing pains with one of our clients over the past
                year, and those are
                the results above.</p>

                        <p class="details" style="display: block;">Initial versions of tech products are necessarily
                            &ldquo;fast and cheap&rdquo; as you experiment and respond to find product/market fit. The
                            pressure to
                            keep delivering and grow at the same time, often leads companies to hire more devs to try
                            and build more. But often, what you’ll see is that delivery starts to take twice as long and
                            cost twice as much. This slow pace of delivery, combined with the cost of the growing tech
                            team, eventually puts an unbearable pressure on cashflow. This is just one symptom of what
                            we call <i>scale fail</i>.</p>

                        <p class="details" style="display: block;">In the growth phase, companies need to be able to
                            take transition steps from one “right-scale” to the next. You might be surprised how small
                            and painless these can be.</p>

                        <p class="details" style="display: block;">Our approach to scaling focuses on four areas—making
                            simpler technology that works harder (think 80% less code), acting as one, enabling you to
                            continue delivering to customers as you make these transitions and building the capability
                            of your teams.</p>
