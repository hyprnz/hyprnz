                    <h4>Engage</h4>
                    <p>As teams and tech stacks become more complex, collaboration becomes more critical. Teams require
                        everyone to behave well—logically, skillfully and consistently. Let's be willing and ready to
                        listen, ask and respond; let's have a social contract to be active and proactive.</p>

                    <h4>Act</h4>
                    <p>Technology change can be overwhelming in complex or even chaotic situations. That's when it is
                        even more important to act small and to probe the situation and learn from how it responds. Only
                        then will we know if what we did was right. </p>

                    <h4>Explain</h4>
                    <p>As tech stack complexity grows, organising teams around technology layers becomes less and less
                        effective. As a consequence everyone needs to have a clearer, wider and deeper understanding. In
                        the end, it is about a willingness to clarify, simplify and collaborate to promote shared
                        understanding. We can do this in a variety of ways: write documents, draw diagrams, speak and
                        summarise for different audiences. </p>

                            being able to adapt and learn is as important as building specific technical skills. When we
                            are in the middle of innovation let's learn from others mistakes and ensure we don't
                            continue making the same mistakes time and time again! </p>

            <h2>Key Approach<span class="yellow-text">.</span></h2>
            <p class="intro">Once we have agreed to start, we target complexity that can be simplified—we break it up
                into manageable parts. For us, world-competitive software capability requires full-stack technologists
                who understand the flow of work and can navigate the tradeoffs between short, mid and long-term business
                goals. And the baseline of this is that you must be able to build and deploy from source through a
                pipeline, and fast through every stage. Transitioning all this takes time, patience, courage and a
                single mindedness, plus a little bit of having been there before. So, we lead by example, guided by
                social coding and reinforced through coaching.</p>
            <h2>Boardroom to keyboard<span class="blue-text">.</span></h2>
            <p class="intro">We've left the <strong>best to last</strong>. Change like this isn't effective unless it is
                viral throughout the organisation. We know that it needs to come from the boardroom and the keyboard at
                the same time; and our role to ensure that the two can find a common language. We help the board to
                understand how to interpret the new information that is coming from build pipeline and ensure that their
                requests are grounded in the reality of what is possible as well as dream of the possible. We work at
                the keyboard to ensure that the team have the capability to respond to the boardroom requests.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>2-8 weeks before you intend to start.</strong></p>
                    <p>For bootcamp, we recommend that you start early on discussions so that we can reach an agreement
                        on how to proceed and give your team as much warning as possible.</p>

                    <p>We will provide materials that can be started on at your own pace. Some work is new material to
                        learn, other parts are ensuring that there is right infrastructure for when we arrive. We will
                        also be doing remote work to ensure that we have a clear picture. </p>

                    <p><strong><span class="blue-text">Length: </span>1-3 months in 1 week cycles</strong></p>
                    <p>We will co-work with your team through a mixture of onsite and remote working. For each week, we
                        ensure there is strategic alignment in the prioritisation of work across: features, technical
                        debt, production triage and process improvements. Throughout the week, we work in a daily
                        delivery cycle of discuss-estimate-act-reestimate-communicate-demo-improve. Each and every day
                        we will see changes going through our pipeline and see improvements to our overall systems.</p>
                    <p>We don’t want to run bootcamp longer than needed. The purpose of bootcamp is to have a chance to
                        work on team, tools and planning while still delivering product. We’re thinking this work is
                        weighted 80/20 respectively. We’ll know you’re ready to graduate when we are ready flip to 80%
                        of work on product—at that stage, we can repeatedly and reliably plan and ship, each and every
                        day.</p>

                        reflect on where we need to be when we take next step.</p>
