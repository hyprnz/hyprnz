            <h2>Case Study: <span class="blue-text">Scaling product performance</span></h2>

            <h4>Situation</h4>

            <p>A startup going into a growth phase was starting to get complaints from existing customers about the
                speed of the product. To keep performance up, their hosting costs were soaring. The system was about to
                reach its limit with the next big customer.</p>
            <h4>Approach</h4>

            <p>We assessed the solution design to understand where load and latency problems occurred. We showed that
                there was no-one place that was the problem. Rather each small problem added up because fixes had been
                incrementally added throughout the system. The solution was to have a simple cohesive solution. We added
                monitoring and tests, shifted hosting with automated deployments, and most importantly showed how a
                single generic, rather than customised, approach to retrieving data is actually robust, faster and less
                intensive.</p>
            <h4>Outcome</h4>

            <p>We did not have to rewrite the system to get the desired performance at scale. Rather we made sure that
                by doing less, the performance goals were able to be met and that developers were also better able
                understand what the system does and evolve it to meet new customer demands.</p>
